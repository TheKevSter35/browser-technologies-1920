## introduction 

Nerdy shirt ink is made as part of a course from @cmda-minor-web 1920. In this course i had to build a website for all the users, With the core funcitions still work in (almost) all browser. Build the site based on progressive enhancement.

### Pleasurable
will add later

### Backlog
- [x] start by making the html page
- [x] basic CSS
- [X] Use npm
- [ ] Split the form in a progressive disclosure to make it in layers
- [ ] Make a start screen so user can make a new shirt or edit a old one.
- [ ] Print the design 
- [ ] save the design (unique code or save the link)
- [ ] JS make it more interactief
- [ ] css Make more animation like the buttons.
 

### Wishlist
- [ ] if user choose a yellow shirt he can't use white text (js)
- 

### For the teachers 

1.  how can i change the text font with the select/option tag in js? With radio buttons it is possible but i don't really know how to target the option tag with js so the text on the shirt will change font.

2. What do you think about the funny/nerdy names for the colors. Is it to much or need to be more nerdy :)

3. how can i make if you typ something in the input it will also add on the shirt with out using the add text button?
